# Meal Planner

Link to web application: https://natemackay.github.io/MealPlanner/Meals/menu.html 

I created this Front-end web application to help an individual better plan their meals. This app took the course of 14 weeks and 140+ hours and uses over 1,000+ lines of code. The app allows the user to view two weeks of meals at a time, and provides a grocery list to ensure the user has everything needed for each meal.
